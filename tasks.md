# tasks.md -- pm-zero v11 Execution Ledger

## Goal Binding
- Vision source: docs/vision.md
- Active goal: Maintain Task Plant under pm-zero v11 with product code changes tracked as explicit tasks.
- Main agent: Claude Code (Sonnet-first) — sole owner of this ledger.
- Implementation: Claude Code main agent; Sonnet worker subagents on disjoint scopes.
- Review: fresh-context Sonnet subagent (Tier 1); Opus (Tier 2) for top-risk classes when available.
- Historical rows below owned "Codex CLI" under pm-zero v9.4; kept as-is for evidence integrity.

## Status Vocabulary
- proposed: idea exists, not ready
- ready: owner, dependencies, write scope, acceptance, verification, and expected evidence are clear
- doing: one owner is actively working
- blocked: needs decision, dependency, credential, environment, or human action
- review: implementation complete, review pending
- done: accepted by reviewer
- verified: evidence recorded

## Parallelization Rules
- The main agent owns tasks.md.
- Worker subagents own only their assigned Write Scope.
- Parallel implementation requires disjoint Write Scopes or worktree isolation.
- If two tasks need the same file, serialize them.
- Default cap: <=2 concurrent worker subagents on a Pro plan.
- Subagents return reports; the main agent updates tasks.md.
